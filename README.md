# ML1-X
Repository for homework and collaboration on the TU Berlin ML1(-X) course.

- I suggest we push our (intermediate) solutions in the Notebooks tagged as **sheet0x-forename.ipynb** if we think it may be useful to others.
- Towards the end of the week we merge our results into **sheet0x-submission.ipynb** and finally create **sheet0x-submission.pdf**, the document to hand in.
- Given solutions are tagged as sheet0x_given_solutions.pdf.
